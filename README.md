This project is based on how a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can predict an image uploaded belongs to the trained classes and which class it belongs to with a higher accuracy and prediction speed.  

To check how the model works, you can follow below steps,  
- Clone the repository.  
- Open CMD in working directory.  
- Run app.py using command "python app.py"  
- Go to the http://127.0.0.1:5000 and test it on any image uploaded. This directs to the local flask app and the respository contains few images to test for instance.
